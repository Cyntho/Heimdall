# This feature enables the bot to take a closer look
# at the activities of certain people, channels or groups
# on your server. Unlike the normal bot instance, channel chat,
# uploads/downloads and movement of clients will be logged.
#
#
# NOTE: Each client you intend to watch using this feature,
#       will (on connect) spawn a ServerQueryClient which will
#       use one of your server's slots! So make sure to not get
#       too deep into this :P


# General settings for this feature
surveillance:
  active: true
  logChannelChatToFile: true
  logChannelChatToDb: false


# Set the credentials you want the queries to use
# DO NOT use the 'ServerAdmin' Query. It's also recommended to
# NOT use the same query the main bot uses.
